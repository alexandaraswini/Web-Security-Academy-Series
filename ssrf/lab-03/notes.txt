Lab #3 - SSRF with blacklist-based input filter

Vulnerable feature - stock check functionality

Goal - change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at http://localhost/admin and delete the user carlos

Analysis:

1. localhost: http://127.1/    Note: 127.1 is automatically fill the octet that are missing in 127.0.0.1, so we are allowed to use that

The above works, so we understand that they are not doing regex match on string 127.1.
Also, you have couple of other option to bypass this. You could use decimal encoded version of the IP_address or the octal representation of the ip address. Please search "IP address to decimal version"

Eg: localhost: http://2130706433/  This should work in burp

The above is one way of bypassing blacklist-based input filter



admin interface: http://127.1/%25%36%31dmin     Note: we need to use url encode full two times in burp to make it work
delete carlos:  http://127.1/%25%36%31dmin/delete?username=carlos


- URL decoding one time
- regex search using a blacklist of strings
