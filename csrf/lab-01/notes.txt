Solution:
Two ways:
1. Burp professional:
  -Intercept the change the email address URL and send to repeater
  -Features: Engagement Tools -> Generate CSRF PoC  (Inside of this, click on Options, and select "Include auto-submit script")

  -Write CSRF PoC
  -Launch web server in the path which contains html script in kali machine 
   cd <html script path>
   python -m SimpleHttpServer 5555
